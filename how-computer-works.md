# How Computer Works - From electrons to High-level languages

## Overview

- In this article, I will provide a concise overview of how computers work, breaking down the complex processes from electrons to high-level languages. We'll explore the role of transistors, the CPU, memory, and high-level languages, highlighting the essential components that make modern computers operate seamlessly.

## Hardware

- Computers work because engineers exploited the physical property that says: "electrons can move freely in metals, generating an electric current." Then they defined a simple alphabet called **Binary**, with only 0 and 1. 0 means without current flowing and 1 means that current was flowing.
- Now these currents flow through electronic devices called **transistors**, today we have more than trillions of transistors on a single chip, and tens to hundreds of chips within a single computer.

## Transistors

- Transistors are tiny switches in a computer that can either let electricity flow or block it. They act as the building blocks of electronic circuits, helping computers process and store information by representing 1s and 0s in binary code. Many transistors together form the basic components of a computer's microprocessor, enabling it to perform tasks and make calculations.

## Logic gates

- Logic gates are fundamental electronic components that uses transistors to perform logical operations.
- These operations involve processing binary signals 0s and 1s.
- There are basic types of logic gates, including AND, OR, and NOT gates.

## ALU - Arithmetic logic unit

- Responsible for the computational tasks and logical decisions that form the core functions of a CPU.
  - It performs arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
  - It performs logical operations (such as AND, OR, and NOT) that are essential for executing computer programs and manipulating data.

## CPU - Central Processing Unit

- Computer's brain. It tells ALU what mathematical operations to perform on data.
- The most complex component is the CPU, also called the **processor**.
- Contains cache to store and access frequently used data and instructions.
  - The cache optimizes performance by reducing the need to access slower main memory, resulting in quicker execution of tasks.

## Memory

- ### RAM - Random Access Memory

  - Temporary storage used by the CPU.
  - Non persistent, this means that once a computer is powered off, the memory is lost. And because of that we call **RAM** "temporary".
  - RAM is used by the CPU to store and quickly access data that is actively being used or processed.
  - The contents of RAM can be quickly read from or written to by the CPU, making it crucial for the system's performance.

- ### Persistent Storage

  - Non volatile, preserved when not powered. Because of that is called persistent storage.
  - Disks are used for long-term storage of the operating system, applications, files, and other data that needs to be preserved even when the computer is powered down.
  - We have more than one type of persistent storage devices.

  ### Hard drive aka Hard disk

  - Stores bytes as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disk.

  ### Flash drive aka Flash memory

  - Stores bytes as electrons in a chip. For example, USB.

  ### File system

  - Organizes the bytes of persistent storages. Provides a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories.
  - When you save a picture, where does it go? Persistent storage and the file system can organize and manage it.
  - "File" is just name to a block of bytes.

## High-level languages

- Now as you already know the hardware components let's talk about how low level languages that communicate with the hardware can be generated by High-level languages.

- ### High-level Languages
  - High-level languages, such as C or Java, are translated into assembly language, which acts as an intermediary layer, allowing communication between software and hardware.
- You can gain a better understanding of this abstraction process by visiting [Compiler vs Transpiler vs Interpreter](/compiler-transpiler-interpreter.md), where we can "convert" one language into another.
